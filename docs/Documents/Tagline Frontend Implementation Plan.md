# Tagline Frontend Implementation Plan

This document breaks down the Tagline frontend implementation into concrete, actionable to-do items organized by phase. Each task is specific enough to be assigned and tracked independently.

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup

### Project Initialization
- [x] Create new Next.js 15 project with TypeScript and App Router
- [x] Set up Tailwind CSS
- [x] Configure shadcn/ui with custom theme
- [x] Set up ESLint and Prettier with appropriate rules
- [x] Create basic directory structure following specification
- [x] Set up environment variables (.env.local and .env.example)
- [x] Configure Docker and docker-compose files

### Authentication Foundation
- [x] Install Stytch dependencies
- [x] Create AuthProvider component and context
- [x] Implement user types and interfaces
- [x] Build JWT handling utilities (verify, decode)
- [x] Create login page with eligibility check UI
- [ ] Implement auth callback page
- [ ] Create auth API proxy endpoints (check-eligibility, session)
- [ ] Build ProtectedRoute component with role checking
- [ ] Implement unauthorized access page

### API Client Setup
- [ ] Create API client with TypeScript interfaces

- [ ] Add lazy loading for list components
- [ ] Set up component code splitting
- [ ] Optimize API calls with SWR/React Query
- [ ] Implement caching strategies
- [ ] Add prefetching for common navigation paths

### UI Polish
- [ ] Create consistent loading states
- [ ] Implement transitions and animations
- [ ] Ensure mobile responsiveness for all components
- [ ] Add hover states and micro-interactions
- [ ] Implement keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Create empty states for all data views

### Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for key components
- [ ] Create integration tests for main user flows
- [ ] Implement E2E tests with Playwright
- [ ] Add accessibility tests
- [ ] Create visual regression tests

### Documentation and Deployment
- [ ] Write developer documentation
- [ ] Create user guide for admins
- [ ] Build comprehensive README
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Configure production deployment
- [ ] Create database migration scripts
- [ ] Final pre-launch testing and QA

## Implementation Priorities

For initial development, focus on these high-priority items:

1. Project setup with authentication (tasks 1-17)
2. Basic UI shell and navigation (tasks 23-27)
3. Core media browser functionality (tasks 28-36)
4. Upload interface for adding content (tasks 43-48)

This provides a functional MVP that allows authorized users to:
- Log in securely
- Browse existing media
- View media details
- Upload new media

Each subsequent phase builds on this foundation, adding more sophisticated features while maintaining a usable application throughout the development process.
